 ############ Coding exercise
# You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

# e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

# The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.
# e.g.

# 180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146

# There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights

# 1146 รท 7 = 163.71428571428572

# Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164
# Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

# Don't change the code below 
# student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
# for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
#   student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# Don't change the code above 


#Write your code below this row 

# print(student_heights)

# count = 0
# summ = 0
# for num in student_heights:
#     count += 1
#     summ += num

# average = round(summ / count)
# print(average)

# total_height = 0

# You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

# e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

# Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e

# The highest score in the class is: x

# Don't change the code below
# from re import S


# student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()

################ for loops and the range() function

# for number in range(1, 11):
#     print(number)


# for number in range(1, 11, 3):
#     print(number)

# total = 0
# for number in range(1, 101):
#     total += number
# print(total)

############################################ Coding exercise:
# You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

# i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

# Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.

#Solution:

# total = 0
# for number in range(2, 101, 2):
#     total += number

# print(total)

############ alternative

# total = 0
# for number in range(1, 101):
#     if number % 2 == 0:
#         total += number

# print(total)

###################################### coding exercise
# You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

# Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

# When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

# `When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`
# `And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"`


##### Solution:

# for number in range(1, 101):
#     if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
#         print("FizzBuzz")
#     elif number % 3 == 0:
#         print("Fizz")
#     elif number % 5 == 0:
#         print("Buzz")
#     else:
#         print(number)
